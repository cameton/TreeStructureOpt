# TreeStructureOpt
A repository for code and graphs submitted to IEEE QCE 2022

(TODO clean and organize this)

The code here will be moved to a more usable package located here: (TODO)

### Required Packages

To add pacakges, you must be Julia's REPL package environment. This can be accessed by "]" once in the REPL. Once in the Pkg REPL, you can type the following

- add "package name"

The packages that are needed are: 

- Graphs 
- DataStructures
- Combinatorics
- Coarsening 
- Revise 
- IJulia (for Jupyter notebook) 
- MatrixMarket
- GraphIO
- LightGraphs
- CuthillMcKee
- QXGraphDecompositions
- ProgressMeter 
- KrylovKit
- LRUCache

### Other packages that are needed for the repo will need to be added in the same way with the corresponding github links.
